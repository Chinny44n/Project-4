STEP 1- INSTALL NodeJs

Updated and upgraded the Ubuntu server to the latest version by running the following codes.

`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt upgrade`

I added certificates using the following commands.

`sudo apt -y install curl dirmngr apt-transport-https lsb-release ca-certificates
`

`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash`

![Image2](./Images/Image2.PNG)

![Image2b](./Images/Image2b.PNG)

Next, NodeJs is installed using the command:

`sudo apt install -y nodejs`

![Image3](./Images/Image3.PNG)

STEP 2- INSTALL MongoDB

For this application,  book records were added to MongoDB that contain book name, isbn number, author, and number of pages..

The following command was used to install MongoDB:

`sudo apt install -y mongodb`

![Image4](./Images/Image4.PNG)

The server is started using the command:

`sudo service mongodb start`

The screen shot below verifies that the server is up and running after running the command:

`sudo systemctl status mongodb`

![Image5](./Images/Image5.PNG)

Next, I installed the Install npm â€“ Node package manager. I had some error messages that prevented the installation so I used the aptitude command to resolve the errors.

`sudo apt aptitude install -y npm`

![Image6](./Images/Image6.PNG)

'Body-parser' package is helpful in processing JSON files passed in request to the server.

The 'Body-parser' package is installed using the command:

`sudo npm install body-parser`

![Image7](./Images/Image7.PNG)

Next, a folder called books will be created. In this folder. npm project was initialized:

`mkdir Books && cd Books`

`npm init`

![Image8](./Images/Image8.PNG)

This created a package.jason file. A file named server.js will be added to it and then opened and the following code added inside and saved.

![Image9](./Images/Image9.PNG)

`vi server.js`


`var express = require('express');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var app = express();
app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
app.use(bodyParser.json());
require('./apps/routes')(app);
app.set('port', 3300);
app.listen(app.get('port'), function() {
    console.log('Server up: http://localhost:' + app.get('port'));
});`

![Image10](./Images/Image10.PNG)

STEP 3- INSTALL EXPRESS AND SET UP ROUTES TO THE SERVER

Express will be used to and from our MongoDB database. Mongoose will be used to establish a schema for the database to store data for the book register.

The command below will be used to install Express and Mongoose.

`sudo npm install express mongoose`

![Image11](./Images/Image11.PNG)

In the books folder, a folder named apps was created. 

`mkdir apps && cd apps`

![Image12](./Images/Image12.PNG)


In the apps folder, a file named routes.js was created and the following code added and saved inside.

`vi routes.js`

`var Book = require('./models/book');
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.get('/book', function(req, res) {
    Book.find({}, function(err, result) {
      if ( err ) throw err;
      res.json(result);
    });
  }); 
  app.post('/book', function(req, res) {
    var book = new Book( {
      name:req.body.name,
      isbn:req.body.isbn,
      author:req.body.author,
      pages:req.body.pages
    });
    book.save(function(err, result) {
      if ( err ) throw err;
      res.json( {
        message:"Successfully added book",
        book:result
      });
    });
  });
  app.delete("/book/:isbn", function(req, res) {
    Book.findOneAndRemove(req.query, function(err, result) {
      if ( err ) throw err;
      res.json( {
        message: "Successfully deleted the book",
        book: result
      });
    });
  });
  var path = require('path');
  app.get('*', function(req, res) {
    res.sendfile(path.join(__dirname + '/public', 'index.html'));
  });
};`

![Image13](./Images/Image13.PNG)

In the apps folder, a folder named models was created:

`mkdir models && cd models`

![Image14](./Images/Image14.PNG)

In the apps folder, a file named book.js was created and the following code added and saved in it.

`vi book.js`

`var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var dbHost = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/test';
mongoose.connect(dbHost);
mongoose.connection;
mongoose.set('debug', true);
var bookSchema = mongoose.Schema( {
  name: String,
  isbn: {type: String, index: true},
  author: String,
  pages: Number
});
var Book = mongoose.model('Book', bookSchema);
module.exports = mongoose.model('Book', bookSchema);`

STEP 4- ACCESS THE ROUTES WITH AngularJS

 AngularJS will be used to connect the  web page with Express and perform actions on the book register.

 I went back to the books directory and created a folder named public.

 ![Image15](./Images/Image15.PNG)

 `cd ../..`

 `mkdir public && cd public`

 ![Image16](./Images/Image16.PNG)

 In the "public" folder, a file named script.js will be opened. The following code will be added and saved in it.

 `vi script.js`

 `var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope, $http) {
  $http( {
    method: 'GET',
    url: '/book'
  }).then(function successCallback(response) {
    $scope.books = response.data;
  }, function errorCallback(response) {
    console.log('Error: ' + response);
  });
  $scope.del_book = function(book) {
    $http( {
      method: 'DELETE',
      url: '/book/:isbn',
      params: {'isbn': book.isbn}
    }).then(function successCallback(response) {
      console.log(response);
    }, function errorCallback(response) {
      console.log('Error: ' + response);
    });
  };
  $scope.add_book = function() {
    var body = '{ "name": "' + $scope.Name + 
    '", "isbn": "' + $scope.Isbn +
    '", "author": "' + $scope.Author + 
    '", "pages": "' + $scope.Pages + '" }';
    $http({
      method: 'POST',
      url: '/book',
      data: body
    }).then(function successCallback(response) {
      console.log(response);
    }, function errorCallback(response) {
      console.log('Error: ' + response);
    });
  };
});`

![Image17](./Images/Image17.PNG)

In the "Public folder", a file named index.html was created and the following code addded and saved in it.

`vi index.html`

`<!doctype html>
<html ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
  <head>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.4/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Name:</td>
          <td><input type="text" ng-model="Name"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Isbn:</td>
          <td><input type="text" ng-model="Isbn"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Author:</td>
          <td><input type="text" ng-model="Author"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Pages:</td>
          <td><input type="number" ng-model="Pages"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <button ng-click="add_book()">Add</button>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Isbn</th>
          <th>Author</th>
          <th>Pages</th>

        </tr>
        <tr ng-repeat="book in books">
          <td>{{book.name}}</td>
          <td>{{book.isbn}}</td>
          <td>{{book.author}}</td>
          <td>{{book.pages}}</td>

          <td><input type="button" value="Delete" data-ng-click="del_book(book)"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>`

![Image18](./Images/Image18.PNG)

I went back to the books directory and the server was started  by running the following command:

`cd ..`

`node server.js`

![Image19](./Images/Image19.PNG)

The screenshot above confirms the server is up and running and can be connected via port 3300.

The curl command below gives a test to see what the command returns locally. The out put is a html page which is hardly readable. 

`curl -s http://localhost:3300`

![Image20](./Images/Image20.PNG)

For this outpout to be clearer, there was need to open Port 3300 in the AWS console for the EC2 instance.

![Image21](./Images/Image21.PNG)

The screen shot below confirms the book register web application from the internet with a browser using a public IP address or a public DNS name can now be accessed.
